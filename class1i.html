          Hello! Welcome to your SMODEL introductory course of the standard
          model of particle physics. By selecting non-STEM Undergraduate/High
          School, you have been placed into the elementary class to introduce
          particle physics. Before we begin, let us address the content your
          course will cover.<br /><br />

          The purpose of the course is to provide a simple, easy to understand
          opportunity for curious minds to be introduced to the theory that
          explains the foundation of our universe. At any point in the course
          the user is encouraged to access the nomenclature page containing the
          vocabulary to assist the user during the course.<br /><br />

          During your SMODEL course you will receive an introduction to the
          standard model theory building a foundation of the idea and concept.
          After understanding the basic concepts of the standard model you will
          begin section I. Section I will begin your journey by discovering the
          first of two families in the standard model: the fermions. Jumping
          into the second section, you will learn about the second family of
          particles: the bosons. This section will be similar to the first.
          <br /><br />

          The standard model is a theory introduced during the 1970's that
          provides our best description of the universe on the subatomic scale.
          The model attempts to connect all particles we have discovered and
          even predicts some particles we hope to discover in the future.
          <br /><br />

          The standard model consists of 17 main particles. That seems like alot
          but we will walk you through them all step by step. We will break the
          particles down into families to help remember and organize the
          similarities and differences between each, slowly building our
          knowledge together. The two main families we will divide particles
          into are the fermions and the bosons. All 17 particles fall into one
          of these two categories. In fact, these two families are so important
          we will have a full section on each throughout the course. For now we
          will leave you with the most important traits of each family. There
          are 12 fermions and this family of particles contains all mass in the
          universe. Meanwhile, researchers have discovered 5 bosons. These 5
          bosons are the force carriers of the four fundamental forces in the
          universe. In other words, these particles are the reason that forces
          exist and we observe interactions because of them. <br /><br />
          “Woah hold on… Before we go any further, what was that about the four
          fundamental forces? That sounds important.” If that was your reaction
          to the last few lines don’t worry-- that's normal. Before we go any
          further, let’s introduce these forces-- you may actually know some of
          them already. The first force is gravity; this is the one we are all
          familiar with. Gravity pulls us down to earth and causes the earth to
          orbit the sun. There is one major issue though, gravity is weird, and
          is the only force that cannot be explained by the standard model. For
          this reason we will not discuss gravity for the remainder of this
          course. If you are interested, the more advanced courses will dive
          into this problem further. Back to the lesson. The second force is the
          electromagnetic force. The electromagnetic force is what makes
          currents flow and our lights come on. The final two forces are the
          weak and strong nuclear forces. We will discuss these forces in this
          course however once again to learn about what these forces do consider
          taking the higher level courses after you have completed all the
          sections we will cover.<br /><br />

          OK! So we know there are 17 particles, two majors families, and 4
          fundamental forces. What else do we need to cover? This part can be a
          bit tricky so brace yourself. All particles have a quantity referred
          to as spin. However, the particles do not actually spin as we think of
          spinning. The reason this quantity is referred to as spin is because
          this quantity shares the same units as angular momentum. Because this
          is a confusing topic, in this course we will refer to spin as quantum
          strength to make things easier to understand. Every particle has this
          quantum strength and quantum strength has some hard numbers to
          memorize. Thankfully physicists have done us a favor. Instead of
          having this quantum strength value, we can simplify this to a quantum
          strength number. Each quantum strength number correlates to a value
          however this makes memorization and classification much easier for
          everyone. These numbers are quantized in increments of ½. This means
          possible quantum strength numbers include, 0, 1/2, 1, 3/2, 2, etc…<br /><br />

          Congratulations! You have finished the introduction to your SMODEL
          course. Look over the questions below highlighting the main points and
          then begin section I.<br /><br />

          If you are feeling overwhelmed, dont worry, this can be confusing.
          After all, that's why we made SMODEL. You wont leave this course as a
          master in particle physics-- that takes years of education-- but
          hopefully throughout the course you can learn a few things about our
          complex universe. <br /><br />
