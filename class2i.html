            Hello! Welcome to your SMODEL introductory course to the standard model of particle physics. By selecting STEM Undergraduate, you have been placed into the advanced introductory particle physics course. Before we begin, let us address the content your course will cover.  <br><br>

            The purpose of the course is to provide a simple, easy to understand opportunity for curious minds to be introduced to the theory that explains the foundation of our universe. At any point in the course the user is encouraged to access the nomenclature page containing the vocabulary to assist the use during the course. <br><br>

            During your SMODEL course you will receive an introduction to the standard model theory building a foundation of the idea and concept. After understanding the basic concepts of the standard model you will begin section I. Section I will begin your journey by discovering the first of two families in the standard model, the fermions. Jumping into the second section, you will learn about the second family of particles, the bosons. This section will be similar to the first. <br><br>

            LET US BEGIN!<br><br>

            The standard model is a theory introduced during the 1970s that provides our best description of the universe on the subatomic scale. The model attempts to connect all particles we have discovered and even predicts some particles we hope to discover in the future. <br><br>

            The standard model consists of 17 main particles. That seems like alot but we will walk you through them all step by step. We will break the particles down into families to help remember and organize the similarities and differences between each, slowly building our knowledge together. The two main families we will divide particles into are the fermions and the bosons. All 17 particles fall into one of these two families. In fact, these two families are so important we will have a full section on each throughout the course. For now we will leave you with the most important traits of each family. There are 12 fermions and this family of particles contains all mass in the universe. Meanwhile, researchers have discovered 5 bosons. These 5 bosons are the force carriers of the four fundamental forces in the universe. In other words, these particles are the reason that forces exist and we observe interactions because of them. <br><br>

            OK. So we know there are 17 particles, two majors families, and 4 fundamental forces. What else do we need to cover? This part can be a bit tricky so brace yourself. All particles have a quantity referred to as spin; however, the particles do not actually spin as we think of spinning. The reason this quantity is referred to as spin is because this quantity shares the same units as angular momentum.  Every particle has this spin and spin has some difficult numbers to memorize. Thankfully physicists have done us a favor, instead of having this spin value, we can simplify this to a spin number. Each spin number correlates to a value however this makes memorization and classification much easier for everyone. These numbers are quantized in increments of ½. This means possible spin numbers include, 0, 1/2, 1, 3/2, 2, etc… <br><br>

            We can calculate the value of spin (S) from the spin number (s) using the following equation and constant ♄ = 1.054 571 817...  x 10-34 J s: <br><br>

            S = Sqrt(s * (s + 1))) * ♄ <br><br>

            Congratulations! You have finished the introduction to your SMODEL course. Look over the questions below highlighting the main points and begin section I. <br><br>

            If you are feeling overwhelmed, don’t worry, this can be confusing, afterall, that's why we made SMODEL. You wont leave this course as a master in particle physics, that takes years of education, but hopefully throughout the course you can learn a few things about our complex universe. <br><br>
