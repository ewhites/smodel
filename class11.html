    <p> Good work! You have stuck around. Most people run away in fear after hearing something with spin is not   spinning. <br><br> 

        During this section we will discuss the bigger of the two particle families, the fermions. As mentioned during the introduction, the fermions are the particles and make up all matter in the universe. This is important, without fermions the universe would be empty. Another important characteristic of these fermions is that no two fermions can exist in the same state. This seems obvious. However, we will see the opposite of this later and this idea becomes more complex in later courses. <br><br>
        There exist 12 fermions and, once more, we can divide these 12 fermions into two primary groups of 6: the quarks and the leptons. In general, the quarks are larger particles with more mass than the leptons. In addition, in order to exist a quark must be bound together with one or more quarks while a lepton can exist independently. <br><br>
        
        The chart below shows the 6 fundamental particles known as quarks, they go by the names; bottom, down, strange, up, top and, charm quarks. These names have no direct meaning and only give us words to call them so truthfully at our level it is not too important to memorize them by name. Additionally we will always have the chart to look back at. What is important however is the charge and quantum strength of the quarks. Thankfully all quarks have a quantum strength number of ½. The chart also shows the bottom, down, and strange quark have a charge of -1/2 and the up, top, and charm quarks have a charge of 2/3. We have not discussed charge up to this point however similar to quantum strength, charge is another quantity to describe a fundamental particle.<br><br>

        This second chart introduces us to the names of the leptons and their charges as well. The six leptons are named; electron neutrino, tau neutrino, muon neutrino, tau, muon and most famously, the electron. Similar to the quarks all leptons also all have a quantum strength of ½. Thank goodness! Now we can remember all 12 fermions have a quantum strength of 1/2-- it's all starting to come together. We also observe the charge of the electron, tau, and muon to be -1 while the three neutrino particles have a charge of 0. <br><br>

        <p>Another way to divide the fermion is into 3 generations: generation I, II and, III. We know creativity, right? These generations are more complex to describe and complicate our understanding in this course so for now it is good enough to know the three generations exist. <br><br>
        
        Before we finish with the fermions, we will address one more smaller point. We said before the quarks must bind together to exist. A special category of bound quarks called a baryon is a particle made up of three quarks. Typically we would not bother with this concept in this course but we feel the connection to be made here is important. The proton and the neutron are baryons, this means that protons and neutrons are particles made of a combination of 3 quarks. <br><br>
        
        That is over half of the 17 fundamental particles done. We are on our way to completing our course. Once again we have provided a few questions to help check our progress before moving forward.<br><br>
        
        Keep up the good work!<br><br>
