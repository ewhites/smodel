                <li><i>Fermion</i> - A family of fundamental particals in the standard model with a spin number of 1/2, 3/2, etc. Fermions are the particles <br> that make up the matter in the universe.</li>
                <li><i>Boson</i> - A family of fundamental particals with spin numbers 0, 1, 2, etc. Bosons are the particals that carry out the interations of the fundemental forces.</li>
                <li><i>Spin</i> - A quanty that every fundemtal parical is observed to have. Spin has the same units as clasical angular momentum; however, the partcals to not actually spin in the classical sense.</li>
                <li><i>Vector</i> - A type of quantity that is described by both magnitude (size or strength) and direction.</li>
                <li><i>Scalar</i> - A type of quantity that is described by only magnitude. </li>
                <li><i>Tensor</i> - Mathematical concept that generalizes a vector. Similar to a vector that can point in all directions.  </li>
                <li><i>Vector Field</i> - Some region that is under the influnce of a vector quantity. </li>
                <li><i>Scalar Field</i> - Some region that is under the influnce of a scalar quantity.</li>
                <li><i>Tensor Field</i> - Some region that is under the influnce of a tensor quantity. </li>
                <li><i>Angular Momentum</i> - Momentum is the product of the mass and velocity, Angular momentum is the rotational anolog of momentum. </li>
                <li><i>Quantized</i> - A distribution that can only be divided into discrete values or steps</li>
                <li><i>Pauli Exclusion Principle</i> - A principal introduced by Austrian physicist Wolfgang Pauli that states no two fermions can exist in the same space at the same time </li>
                <li><i>Matter</i> - A substance that has mass and ocupies space. </li>
                <li><i>Force</i> - A vector quantity that can influence the motion of objects</li>
                <li><i>Quarks</i> - The heavier set of six fermions that must bind together to exist.</li>
                <li><i>Leptons</i> - The lighter set of six fermions that can exist indepentdently.</li>
                <li><i>Baryons</i> - A set of three Quarks bound together.</li>
                <li><i>Mesons</i> - A set of two Quarks bound together.</li>
                <li><i>Hadrons</i> - Any set of Quarks bound together by the nuclear strong force. </li>
                <li><i>Proton</i> - A common Baryon made of two up quarks and one down quark. Protons are one of two particles in the nucleus of the atom.</li>
                <li><i>Neutron</i> - A common Baryon made of two down quarks and one up quark. Neutrons are one of two particles in the nucleus of the atom. </li>
                <li><i>Neutrino</i> - A subcatagory of 3 leptons that are extremly small in mass and nearly impossible to interact with. </li>
                <li><i>Nucleons</i> - A particle in that exists in the nucleus of an atom</li>
                <li><i>Generations</i> - Generations are a 3 divisions of fermions that each contain 2 quarks and two leptons. The generations have different quantum spin numbers and mass but have the same electric and strong interactions. </li>
                <li><i>Electro-magnetic force</i> - One of the four fundemental forces. The interations of the Electromagnetic force are carried out by the photon. </li>
                <li><i>Gravity</i> - One of the four fundemental forces. The force of gravity has no known boson that carries out it's interactions.</li>
                <li><i>Weak nuclear force</i> - One of the four fundemental forces. The weak nuclear force is carried out by the W and Z bosons</li>
                <li><i>Strong nuclear force</i> - One of the four fundemental forces. The strong nuclear force is carried out by the gluon.</li>
                <li><i>Spin number</i> - Spin number is a quantum number to desrcibe the spin angular momentum of a particle. </li>
                <li><i>Hyperons</i> - A Baryon that contains strange quarks but no charm, bottom or top quark. </li>
