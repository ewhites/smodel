            Only five more particles left! We got this. <br><br>

            Returning back to our introduction we can remember the second main family in the standard model, the bosons. Bosons, unlike the fermions, can exist in the same state as other bosons as alluded to before. Bosons are also known as force carriers, this is not true for all bosons though, more on that later.  <br><br>

            Once again we divide the bosons into two groups. Are you starting to see the pattern here? Bosons can be described as vector bosons or scalar bosons. If the concepts of vectors and scalars are new to you check out our nomenclature page to catch yourself up.<br><br>

            Now that we all know the differences between vectors and scalars, let us take this concept a bit further. A boson that is a vector boson will influence the region surrounding it creating a vector field. Similarly, a scalar boson will influence the region surrounding it creating a scalar field. Scalar fields are like a topographic map, at each point we can assign an elevation or a value. Meanwhile a vector field can be compared as the lines that give the direction up the mountain. This analogy isnâ€™t perfect; however, without a full foundational physics knowledge, it is best we can do. <br><br>

            OK that was a little rough, but we got through it all. Refer to the vocabulary list again to help understand the ideas if needed. <br><br>

            Now let's familiarize ourselves with two types of bosons:<br><br>

            The bigger family is the vector bosons. The vector bosons are; gluons, W-bosons, Z-bosons, and Photons. These are the fundamental force carrying bosons. The gluon interactions carry out the Strong nuclear force, the W and Z boson interactions carry out the weak nuclear force, and lastly the photon interactions carry out the electromagnetic force. Thankfully each vector boson has a quantum strength of 1. This makes it easy to remember.<br><br>

            The second family is the scalar boson. There is only one scalar boson and this is our last particle, the Higgs boson. The Higgs boson is special, only being discovered in 2012-- the boson had been theorized for years upon years. The Higgs is also the only fundamental particle with quantum strength of 0. This is what makes the Higgs boson different from the rest. Lastly the boson is responsible for the generation of particle mass. We know that it is a bit confusing and a horrible place to end our course because the fermions make up the matter in the universe but trust us on this one, our higher complexity courses explain this concept further if you are curious to discover more. <br><br>

            Good work you have completed all your lessons! You have your final knowledge check below to check your understanding of the final section. <br><br>
