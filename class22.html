          Only five more particles left! We’ve got this. <br /><br />

          Returning back to our introduction we can remember the second main
          family in the standard model, the bosons. Bosons, unlike the fermions,
          can exist in the same state as other bosons as we alluded to before.
          Bosons are also known as force carriers. This isn’t true for all
          bosons though, more on that later.<br /><br />

          Once again we divide the bosons into two groups. Are you starting to
          see the pattern here? Bosons can be described as vector bosons or
          scalar bosons. If the concepts of vectors and scalars are new to you
          check out our nomenclature page to catch yourself up. <br /><br />
          Now that we all know the differences between vectors and scalars let
          us take this concept a bit further. A boson that is a vector boson
          will influence the region surrounding it creating a vector field.
          Similarly, a scalar boson will influence the region surrounding it
          creating a scalar field. Scalar fields are like a topographic map, at
          each point we can assign an elevation or a value. Meanwhile a vector
          field can be compared to the lines that give the direction up the
          mountain on a topographical map (for those of you with more math
          experience this is a gradient). This analogy isn’t perfect; however,
          without a full foundational physics knowledge, it is best we can do.
          <br /><br />

          OK that was a little rough, but we got through it, refer to the
          vocabulary list again to help understand the ideas if needed.
          <br /><br />

          Now let's familiarize ourselves with two types of bosons:<br /><br />

          The bigger family is the vector bosons. The vector bosons are; gluons,
          W-bosons, Z-bosons, and Photons. These are the fundamental force
          carrying bosons. The gluon interactions carry out the Strong nuclear
          force, the W and Z boson interactions carry out the weak nuclear
          force, and lastly the photon interactions carry out the
          electromagnetic force. Thankfully each vector boson has a spin of 1.
          This makes it easy to remember. <br /><br />

          The second family is the scalar boson. There is only one scalar boson
          and this is our last particle, the Higgs boson. The Higgs boson is
          special, only being discovered in 2012-- the boson had been theorized
          for years upon years. The Higgs is also the only fundamental particle
          with quantum spin of 0. This is what makes the Higgs boson different
          from the rest. Lastly the boson is responsible for the generation of
          particle mass.<br /><br />

          We now know that there are vector and scalar bosons. We also know that
          vector bosons have a spin number of one and scalar bosons have a spin
          number of zero. As you can probably assume these two characteristics
          are related. The scalar bosons influence the region with a scalar
          because the boson has a spin of zero. Similarly the vector bosons
          influence the region with a vector field because the boson has a spin
          of one. <br /><br />OK, so this all makes sense but lets Take this
          idea a bit further. Up until this point we have avoided addressing one
          of the primary issues with the standard model. The standard model
          provides no explanation for the force of gravity. All other
          fundamental forces in the standard model force carry while there is no
          boson for the force of gravity. There are a few theories that include
          the hypothetical “graviton” however, there is no evidence to back up
          this theory. Another reason for this is gravity creates a tensor field
          the next step up from a vector field. This is a complex topic that is
          too mathematically difficult for the purpose of the program. On the
          other hand by understanding that gravity is a tensor field we can
          conclude that if a graviton exists, the boson must be a boson with a
          spin number of 2, something physicists are yet to observe.
