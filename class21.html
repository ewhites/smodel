            Good work! You’ve stuck around. Most people run away in fear after hearing something with spin isn’t spinning. <br><br>

            During this section we will discuss the bigger of the two particle families, the fermions. As mentioned during the introduction, the fermions are the particles and make up all matter in the universe. This is important, without fermions the universe would be empty. Another important characteristic of these fermions is the pauli exclusion principle. The principle was stated in 1925 by wolfgang Pauli, an Austrian physicist. Pauli suggested that no two fermions (particles with half integer spins) can exist in the same state; this seems obvious; however, we will see the opposite of this later. This principle is often taught in introductory chemistry courses with electron configurations at the undergraduate level, meaning many of you are familiar with this rule. <br><br>
            
            There exist 12 fermions and, once more, we can divide these 12 fermions into two primary groups of 6; the quarks and the leptons. In general the quarks are larger particles with more mass than the leptons. In addition, in order to exist a quark must be bound together with one or more quarks while a lepton can exist independently. <br><br>
            
            The chart below shows the 6 fundamental particles known as quarks, they go by the names; bottom, down, strange, up, top and, charm quarks. These names have no direct meaning and only give us words to call them so truthfully at our level it is not too important to memorize them by name. Additionally we will always have the chart to look back at. What is important however is the charge and quantum strength of the quarks. Thankfully all quarks have spin numbers of ½. The chart also shows the bottom, down, and strange quark have a charge of -⅓ and the up, top, and charm quarks have a charge of ⅔. We have not discussed charge up to this point however similar to quantum strength, charge is another quantity to describe a fundamental particle. <br><br>

            Let us dig a little deeper into the properties of quarks. As mentioned above quarks must be bound together with other quarks. These quarks are bound together by the strong nuclear force-- more on that in the next section. Nonetheless, the two most common forms of bonds quarks make are baryons and mesons. Baryons are 3 quarks bound together while a meson is two quarks bound together. Both protons and neutrons are examples of Baryons. A proton is two up quarks and one down quark. <br><br>When applying conservation of charge we can see 2/3 + 2/3 - 1/3 = 1; therefore, the charge of the proton is 1 as expected. The same idea applies to the neutron, the neutron is made of two down quarks and one up quark. Once again, applying conservation of charge we see, -1/3 - 1/3 + 2/3 = 0; therefore the charge of a neutron is 0 as expected. The same rules of conservation of charge apply to mesons and, scientists also observe conservation of spin among both mesons and baryons. <br><br> 

            This second chart introduces us to the names of the leptons and their charges as well. The six leptons are named: electron neutrino, tau neutrino, muon neutrino, tau, muon and most famously, the electron. Similar to the quarks, all leptons also all have a quantum spin of 1/2. Thank goodness! Now we can remember all 12 fermions have a quantum spin of 1/2-- it's all starting to come together. We also observe the charge of the electron, tau, and muon to be -1 while the three neutrino particles have a charge of 0. <br><br>

            Another way to divide the fermion is into 3 generations: generation I, II and, III. We know creativity, right? These generations are more complex to describe and complicate our understanding in this course so for now it is good enough to know the three generations exist. <br><br>

            Alright, let us discuss neutrinos. Why are there three separate particles that are all considered neutrinos? Neutrinos are special little particles, as we said before leptons are much lighter than quarks, and neutrinos are the lightest of them all. The neutrinos are so light that physicists are still unsure of the value of their mass. These particles are so tiny the theory of the standard model even predicts they have zero mass at all. Additionally as the chart shows the particles have zero charge. This means it is nearly impossible to detect let alone interact with neutrinos at all.  <br><br>
           
           Whew! That’s over half of the 17 fundamental particles done. We are on our way to completing our course. Once again we have provided a few questions to help check our progress before moving forward. <br><br>
           
           Keep up the good work!<br><br>
